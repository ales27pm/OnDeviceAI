## Fastlane Match Setup

Fastlane Match requires a separate repository for certificates:

1. Create a new **private** repository: `your-org/your-app-certificates`
2. Initialize it with a README
3. Set `MATCH_PASSWORD` to a secure password
4. The first deployment will initialize the certificates

## Verification

After setting up secrets, test the pipeline:

1. Create a test branch
2. Push changes
3. Check that the CI/CD pipeline runs without secret errors
4. Verify iOS deployment works (may require certificate setup)

## Security Notes

- Never commit secrets to your repository
- Use app-specific passwords, not your main Apple ID password
- Regularly rotate secrets
- Use least-privilege access for service accounts
